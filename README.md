# FizzBuzz Solution
This is a FizzBuzz solution that goes from 1 to 1 million. I know it may not be the best solution, but I'm just starting to learn programming so I'm happy with the result.

**fizzbuzz.py** is the solution, and to run the program, download the file and run it by using the Python interpreter, with the command "*py fizzbuzz.py*".
